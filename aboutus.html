      <h2 class="mb-3">What Does Electronic Test Equipment Do?</h2>
      <p>Electronic Test Equipment provides customers with New, New Surplus, and Refurbished/Reconditioned test equipment from manufacturers like Tektronix, Agilent / Keysight, Rohde Schwarz, Anritsu, BK Precision, Teledyne LeCroy, and many more! We focus on offering customers a high-quality replacement to existing units. Where the distributors try to push you onto the latest products, we track down your exact model you’ve been looking for, despite being discontinued. When we ship a reconditioned unit, we often hear feedback like “I think you sent me new by mistake” because our quality is just that good. We include sub-assemblies and documentation such as a data sheet or manual, probes, power cables and more – all in a timely manner in order to keep you in the game. Electronic Test Equipment offers Repair & Calibration services as well, including trade-in and core exchange opportunities.</p>
      <h2 class="mb-3">History of Electronic Test Equipment</h2>
      <p>Our first introduction to the world of Test Equipment began in 2011. Having worked with a variety of industrial automation applications, we realized a tremendous demand amongst our customers for a troubleshooting solution. Ranging from manufacturing plants to nuclear facilities to car washes, the founders of Electronic Test Equipment noticed a trend – users could not identify the problems with their systems. These customers pointed out a hole in the marketplace: “Why can’t I find the same quality in service in the test equipment business?” As you very well know, this is a common question amongst engineers who know the quality of standards and services like the back of their hand. We aim to fill the void by launching our company into the marketplace.</p>
      <p>Electronic Test Equipment is relatively new to the marketplace, which means we’re a small business and that’s what keeps the quality of customer service so high. When you call Electronic Test Equipment, you don’t get a menu – you get a person, ready to answer your questions, solve your problems, being based in North Carolina we can, of course recommend the best local BBQ joints.</p>
      <p>Our multi-million-dollar inventory includes New, New Surplus and Reconditioned products at extremely competitive prices. Our knowledgeable staff will go the extra yard to help you satisfy your customer or get your facility up and running.</p>
      <p>We’re family owned and operated, with decades of engineers in the family. Because we know the marketplace so well, we can work with you and consistently exceeds expectations – from the time it takes to receive your quote, the quality of delivery and simplicity of billing & shipping, Electronic Test Equipment has proven to be the peak of Test & Measurement providers.</p>
